The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the tlverse, or a Targeted Learning Practitioner’s Handbook is an in-draft book covering the same topics in greater detail and may serve as a useful accompanying resource to these workshop materials. Important links Software installation Please install the relevant software before the workshop. installation script You will probably exceed the GitHub API rate limit during this installation, and this will throw an error. This issue and the solution are addressed here. Code R script files for each section of the workshop are available via the GitHub repository for the short course. https://github.com/tlverse/csp2020-workshop/tree/master/handbook/R About this workshop This 1-day workshop will provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of Targeted Learning and the corresponding tlverse software ecosystem. In particular, we will focus on targeted minimum loss estimators of causal effects, including those of static and dynamic treatments (as well as those of optimal dynamic and stochastic interventions, time permitting). These multiply robust, efficient plug-in estimators use state-of-the-art, ensemble machine learning tools to flexibly adjust for confounding while yielding valid statistical inference. We will discuss the utility of this robust estimation strategy in comparison to conventional techniques, which often rely on restrictive statistical models and may therefore lead to severely biased inference. In addition to discussion, this workshop will incorporate both interactive activities and hands-on, guided R programming exercises, to allow participants the opportunity to familiarize themselves with methodology and tools that will translate to real-world causal inference analyses. It is highly recommended for participants to have an understanding of basic statistical concepts such as confounding, probability distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics may be useful but is not necessary. Familiarity with the R programming language will be essential. Outline The materials are based on those from a full-day workshop that featured modules centered around distinct causal questions, each motivated by a case study, alongside statistical methodology and software for assessing the causal claim of interest. Topics covered in that workshop included Introduction to the tlverse software ecosystem The Roadmap of Targeted Learning, and the WASH Benefits data Why we need a statistical revolution Ensemble machine learning with the sl3 R package Targeted learning for causal inference with the tmle3 R package Targeted learning for causal inference with the tmle3 R package Optimal treatment regimes and the tmle3mopttx R package Stochastic treatment regimes and the tmle3shift R package About the instructors and authors Mark van der Laan Mark van der Laan, Ph.D., is Professor of Biostatistics and Statistics at UC Berkeley.

["motivation.html", "Motivation", " Motivation “One enemy of robust science is our humanity — our appetite for being right, and our tendency to find patterns in noise, to see supporting evidence for what we already believe is true, and to ignore the facts that do not fit.” — (“Let’s Think About Cognitive Bias” 2015) Scientific research is at a unique point in history. The need to improve rigor and reproducibility in our field is greater than ever; corroboration moves science forward, yet there is a growing alarm about results that cannot be reproduced and that report false discoveries (Baker 2016). Consequences of not meeting this need will result in further decline in the rate of scientific progression, the reputation of the sciences, and the public’s trust in its findings (Munafò et al. 2017; “How Scientists Fool Themselves – and How They Can Stop” 2015). “The key question we want to answer when seeing the results of any scientific study is whether we can trust the data analysis.” — Peng (2015) Unfortunately, at its current state the culture of data analysis and statistics actually enables human bias through improper model selection. All hypothesis tests and estimators are derived from statistical models, so to obtain valid estimates and inference it is critical that the statistical model contains the process that generated the data. Perhaps treatment was randomized or only depended on a small number of baseline covariates; this knowledge should and can be incorporated in the model. Alternatively, maybe the data is observational, and there is no knowledge about the data-generating process (DGP). If this is the case, then the statistical model should contain all data distributions. In practice; however, models are not selected based on knowledge of the DGP, instead models are often selected based on (1) the p-values they yield, (2) their convenience of implementation, and/or (3) an analysts loyalty to a particular model. This practice of “cargo-cult statistics — the ritualistic miming of statistics rather than conscientious practice,” (Stark and Saltelli 2018) is characterized by arbitrary modeling choices, even though these choices often result in different answers to the same research question. That is, “increasingly often, [statistics] is used instead to aid and abet weak science, a role it can perform well when used mechanically or ritually,” as opposed to its original purpose of safeguarding against weak science (Stark and Saltelli 2018). This presents a fundamental drive behind the epidemic of false findings that scientific research is suffering from (van der Laan and Starmans 2014). “We suggest that the weak statistical understanding is probably due to inadequate”statistics lite&quot; education. This approach does not build up appropriate mathematical fundamentals and does not provide scientifically rigorous introduction into statistics. Hence, students’ knowledge may remain imprecise, patchy, and prone to serious misunderstandings. What this approach achieves, however, is providing students with false confidence of being able to use inferential tools whereas they usually only interpret the p-value provided by black box statistical software. While this educational problem remains unaddressed, poor statistical practices will prevail regardless of what procedures and measures may be favored and/or banned by editorials.&quot; — Szucs and Ioannidis (2017) Our team at The University of California, Berkeley, is uniquely positioned to provide such an education. Spearheaded by Professor Mark van der Laan, and spreading rapidly by many of his students and colleagues who have greatly enriched the field, the aptly named “Targeted Learning” methodology targets the scientific question at hand and is counter to the current culture of “convenience statistics” which opens the door to biased estimation, misleading results, and false discoveries. Targeted Learning restores the fundamentals that formalized the field of statistics, such as the that facts that a statistical model represents real knowledge about the experiment that generated the data, and a target parameter represents what we are seeking to learn from the data as a feature of the distribution that generated it (van der Laan and Starmans 2014). In this way, Targeted Learning defines a truth and establishes a principled standard for estimation, thereby inhibiting these all-too-human biases (e.g., hindsight bias, confirmation bias, and outcome bias) from infiltrating analysis. “The key for effective classical [statistical] inference is to have well-defined questions and an analysis plan that tests those questions.” — Nosek et al. (2018) Our objective is to provide training to students, researchers, industry professionals, faculty in science, public health, statistics, and other fields to empower them with the necessary knowledge and skills to utilize the sound methodology of Targeted Learning — a technique that provides tailored pre-specified machines for answering queries, so that each data analysis is completely reproducible, and estimators are efficient, minimally biased, and provide formal statistical inference. Just as the conscientious use of modern statistical methodology is necessary to ensure that scientific practice thrives, it remains critical to acknowledge the role that robust software plays in allowing practitioners direct access to published results. We recall that “an article…in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures,” thus making the availability and adoption of robust statistical software key to enhancing the transparency that is an inherent aspect of science (Buckheit and Donoho 1995). For a statistical methodology to be readily accessible in practice, it is crucial that it is accompanied by robust user-friendly software (Pullenayegum et al. 2016; Stromberg and others 2004). The tlverse software ecosystem was developed to fulfill this need for the Targeted Learning methodology. Not only does this software facilitate computationally reproducible and efficient analyses, it is also a tool for Targeted Learning education since its workflow mirrors that of the methodology. In particular, the tlverse paradigm does not focus on implementing a specific estimator or a small set of related estimators. Instead, the focus is on exposing the statistical framework of Targeted Learning itself — all R packages in the tlverse ecosystem directly model the key objects defined in the mathematical and theoretical framework of Targeted Learning. What’s more, the tlverse R packages share a core set of design principles centered on extensibility, allowing for them to be used in conjunction with each other and built upon one other in a cohesive fashion. In this workshop, the reader will embark on a journey through the tlverse ecosystem. Guided by R programming exercises, case studies, and intuitive explanation readers will build a toolbox for applying the Targeted Learning statistical methodology, which will translate to real-world causal inference analyses. Participants need not be a fully trained statistician to begin understanding and applying these methods. However, it is highly recommended for participants to have an understanding of basic statistical concepts such as confounding, probability distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics may be useful but is not necessary. Familiarity with the R programming language will be essential. We also recommend an understanding of introductory causal inference. For introductory materials for learning the R programming language we recommend the following free resources: Software Carpentry’s Programming with R Software Carpentry’s R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis Grolemund and Wickham’s R for Data Science For causal inference learning materials we recommend the following resources: Hernán MA, Robins JM (2019).

The tlverse is a new framework for doing Targeted Learning in R, inspired by the tidyverse ecosystem of R packages. By analogy to the tidyverse: The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. So, the tlverse is an opinionated collection of R packages for Targeted Learning sharing an underlying philosophy, grammar, and set of data structures 1.3 tlverse components These are the main packages that represent the core of the tlverse: sl3: Modern Super Learning with Pipelines What? A modern object-oriented re-implementation of the Super Learner algorithm, employing recently developed paradigms for R programming. Why? A design that leverages modern tools for fast computation, is forward-looking, and can form one of the cornerstones of the tlverse. tmle3: An Engine for Targeted Learning What? A generalized framework that simplifies Targeted Learning by identifying and implementing a series of common statistical estimation procedures. Why? A common interface and engine that accommodates current algorithmic approaches to Targeted Learning and is still flexible enough to remain the engine even as new techniques are developed. In addition to the engines that drive development in the tlverse, there are some supporting packages – in particular, we have two… origami: A Generalized Framework for Cross-Validation What? A generalized framework for flexible cross-validation Why? Cross-validation is a key part of ensuring error estimates are honest and preventing overfitting. It is an essential part of the both the Super Learner algorithm and Targeted Learning. delayed: Parallelization Framework for Dependent Tasks What? A framework for delayed computations (futures) based on task dependencies. Why? Efficient allocation of compute resources is essential when deploying large-scale, computationally intensive algorithms. A key principle of the tlverse is extensibility. That is, we want to support new Targeted Learning estimators as they are developed. The model for this is new estimators are implemented in additional packages using the core packages above. There are currently two featured examples of this: tmle3mopttx: Optimal Treatments in tlverse What? Learn an optimal rule and estimate the mean outcome under the rule Why? Optimal Treatment is a powerful tool in precision healthcare and other settings where a one-size-fits-all treatment approach is not appropriate. tmle3shift: Shift Interventions in tlverse What? Shift interventions for continuous treatments Why? Not all treatment variables are discrete. Being able to estimate the effects of continuous treatment represents a powerful extension of the Targeted Learning approach. 1.4 Installation The tlverse ecosystem of packages are currently hosted at https://github.com/tlverse, not yet on CRAN. You can use the devtools package to install them: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;tlverse/tlverse&quot;) The tlverse depends on a large number of other packages that are also hosted on GitHub. Because of this, you may see the following error: Error: HTTP error 403. API rate limit exceeded for 71.204.135.82. (But here&#39;s the good news: Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation for more details.) Rate limit remaining: 0/60 Rate limit reset at: 2019-03-04 19:39:05 UTC To increase your GitHub API rate limit - Use `usethis::browse_github_pat()` to create a Personal Access Token. - Use `usethis::edit_r_environ()` and add the token as `GITHUB_PAT`. This just means that R tried to install too many packages from GitHub in too short of a window. To fix this, you need to tell R how to use GitHub as your user (you’ll need a GitHub user account). Follow these two steps: Type usethis::browse_github_pat() in your R console, which will direct you to GitHub’s page to create a New Personal Access Token. Create a Personal Access Token simply by clicking “Generate token” at the bottom of the page. Copy your Personal Access Token, a long string of lowercase letters and numbers. Type usethis::edit_r_environ() in your R console, which will open your .Renviron file in the source window of RStudio. In your .Renviron file, type GITHUB_PAT= and then paste your Personal Access Token after the equals symbol with no space. In your .Renviron file, press the enter key to ensure that your .Renviron ends with a newline. Save your .Renviron file. Restart R for changes to take effect. You can restart R via the drop-down menu on the “Session” tab. The “Session” tab is at the top of the RStudio interface. After following these steps, you should be able to successfully install the package which threw the error above. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 The Targeted Learning Roadmap 2.1 The Statistical Model 2.2 The Causal Model 2.3 The Parameter of Interest 2.4 Identifiability 2.5 Estimators: SuperLearning and Targeted Maximum Likelihood 2.6 The WASH Benefits Example Dataset", " Chapter 2 The Targeted Learning Roadmap A central goal of the Targeted Learning statistical paradigm is to estimate scientifically relevant parameters in realistic (usually nonparametric) models and to do so with finite-sample robustness and consistent inference. 2.1 The Statistical Model Assume we have an i.i.d. sample of confounders, a binary intervention of interest, and an outcome, or are observed data is \\[ O = (W, A, Y).\\] The distribution of the observed data may be factorized as follows: \\[P(O) = P(W, A, Y) = P(W)P (A \\mid W) P(Y \\mid A, W).\\] To estimate a parameter of interest, a researcher need not necessarily be able to specify these whole or conditional distributions. Rather, each estimator only requires that certain parts of the distribution be known; for example, some may require estimates of \\(\\mathbb{E}(Y \\mid A, W)\\), the mean of \\(Y\\) within subgroups \\((A, W)\\), or the regression of the outcome on the exposure and confounders. At this stage in the roadmap, the researcher must specify a choice of statistical model to be used in estimating \\(\\mathbb{E}(Y \\mid A, W)\\) or other elements of the probability distribution needed to estimate the parameter of interest. Here, statistical model means any constraints on the model form that may be imposed by knowledge about the data-generating process – that is, known aspects of how the data were generated. Typically, the true model is a very large model, placing few constraints, if any, on the data-generating distribution, or a semi-parametric model. With few constraints on the data-generating distribution, and a potentially large number of covariates, data-adaptive, machine-learning approaches remain the only practical option for estimating components of the likelihood. The remainder of this course concerns how to do this as efficiently and robustly as possible, depending on the goal of the analysis. 2.2 The Causal Model The next step in the roadmap is to use a causal framework to formalize the experiment and thereby define the parameter of interest. Causal graphs are one useful tool to express what we know about the causal relations among variables that are relevant to the question under study (Pearl 2009). Ignoring error terms, we will assume the following ordering of the variables in \\(O\\). While directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) like above provide a convenient means by which to visualize causal relations between variables, the causal relations among variables can be represented via a set of structural equations: \\[\\begin{align*} W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\\\ A &amp;= f_A(W, U_A) \\\\ Y &amp;= f_Y(W, A, U_Y), \\end{align*}\\] where \\(U_W\\), \\(U_A\\), and \\(U_Y\\) represent the unmeasured exogenous background characteristics that influence the value of each variable. In the NPSEM, \\(f_W\\), \\(f_A\\) and \\(f_Y\\) denote that each variable (for \\(W\\), \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\), respectively) is a function of its parents and unmeasured background characteristics, but one typically has little information about particular functional constraints (e.g., linear, logit-linear, only one interaction, etc.). For this reason, they are called non-parametric structural equation models (NPSEMs). The DAG and set of nonparametric structural equations represent exactly the same information and so may be used interchangeably. 2.3 The Parameter of Interest The first hypothetical experiment we will consider is assigning exposure to the whole population and observing the outcome, and then assigning no exposure to the whole population and observing the outcome. On the nonparametric structural equations, this corresponds to a comparison of the outcome distribution in the population under two interventions: \\(A\\) is set to \\(1\\) for all individuals, and \\(A\\) is set to \\(0\\) for all individuals. These interventions imply two new nonparametric structural equation models. For the case \\(A = 1\\), we have \\[\\begin{align*} W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\\\ A &amp;= 1 \\\\ Y(1) &amp;= f_Y(W, 1, U_Y), \\end{align*}\\] and for the case \\(A=0\\), \\[\\begin{align*} W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\\\ A &amp;= 0 \\\\ Y(1) &amp;= f_Y(W, 0, U_Y). \\end{align*}\\] In these equations, \\(A\\) is no longer a function of \\(W\\) because we have intervened on the system, setting \\(A\\) deterministically to either of the values \\(1\\) or \\(0\\). The new symbols \\(Y(1)\\) and \\(Y(0)\\) indicate the outcome variable in our population if it were generated by the respective NPSEMs above; these are often called counterfactuals. The difference between the means of the outcome under these two interventions defines a parameter that is often called the “average treatment effect” (ATE), denoted \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:ate} ATE = \\mathbb{E}_X(Y(1)-Y(0)), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbb{E}_X\\) is the mean under the theoretical (unobserved) full data \\(X = (W, Y(1), Y(0))\\). Note, we can define much more complicated interventions on NPSEM’s, such as interventions based upon rules (themselves based upon covariates), stochastic rules, etc. and each results in a different targeted parameter and entails different identifiability assumptions discussed below. 2.4 Identifiability Because we can never observe both \\(Y(0)\\) (the counterfactual outcome when \\(A=0\\)) and \\(Y(1)\\), we cannot estimate directly. Instead, we have to make assumptions under which this quantity may be estimated from the observed data \\(O \\sim P_0\\) under the data-generating distribution \\(P_0\\). Fortunately, given the causal model specified in the NPSEM above, we can, with a handful of untestable assumptions, estimate the ATE, even from observational data. These assumptions may be summarized as follows The causal graph implies \\(Y(a) \\perp A\\) for all \\(a \\in \\mathcal{A}\\), which is the randomization assumption. In the case of observational data, the analogous assumption is strong ignorability or no unmeasured confounding \\(Y(a) \\perp A \\mid W\\) for all \\(a \\in \\mathcal{A}\\); Although not represented in the causal graph, also required is the assumption of no interference between units, that is, the outcome for unit \\(i\\) \\(Y_i\\) is not affected by exposure for unit \\(j\\) \\(A_j\\) unless \\(i=j\\); Consistency of the treatment mechanism is also required, i.e., the outcome for unit \\(i\\) is \\(Y_i(a)\\) whenever \\(A_i = a\\), an assumption also known as “no other versions of treatment”; It is also necessary that all observed units, across strata defined by \\(W\\), have a bounded (non-deterministic) probability of receiving treatment – that is, \\(0 &lt; P_0(A = a \\mid W) &lt; 1\\) for all \\(a\\) and \\(W\\). This assumption is referred to as positivity. Remark: Together, (2) and (3), the assumptions of no interference and consistency, respectively, are jointly referred to as the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). Given these assumptions, the ATE may be re-written as a function of \\(P_0\\), specifically \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:estimand} ATE = \\mathbb{E}_0(Y(1) - Y(0)) = \\mathbb{E}_0 \\left(\\mathbb{E}_0[Y \\mid A = 1, W] - \\mathbb{E}_0[Y \\mid A = 0, W]\\right), \\end{equation}\\] or the difference in the predicted outcome values for each subject, under the contrast of treatment conditions (\\(A = 0\\) vs. \\(A = 1\\)), in the population, averaged over all observations. Thus, a parameter of a theoretical “full” data distribution can be represented as an estimand of the observed data distribution. Significantly, there is nothing about the representation in that requires parametric assumptions; thus, the regressions on the right hand side may be estimated freely with machine learning. With different parameters, there will be potentially different identifiability assumptions and the resulting estimands can be functions of different components of \\(P_0\\). We discuss several more complex estimands in later sections of this workshop. 2.5 Estimators: SuperLearning and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Although we will discuss more in later sections, the goals of the estimators we desire should be that, among sensible (asymptotically consistent, regular) estimators, the estimator be asymptotically efficient in the statistical model of interest, and the estimator can be constructed for finite-sample performance improvements, relative to other estimators in the same class. These principles guide our approach to estimation: Super Learning for prediction (more generally density estimation) and TMLE for estimation of our intervention parameters of interest. 2.5.1 Super Learning There is no universally optimal machine learning algorithm for density estimation or prediction. When we have tested different algorithms on actual data and looked at the performance (e.g., MSE of prediction), never does one algorithm always win (see below). For some data, one needs learners that can model a complex function. For others, typically the result of noise or insufficient sample size, a simple, parametric model might fit best. SuperLearner, an ensemble learner, solves this issue, by allowing a convex combination of learners from the simplest (intercept-only) to most complex (neural nets, random forests, SVM, etc). It works by using cross-validation in a manner which guarantees that the resulting fit will be as good as possible, given the learners provided (note, even a convex combination of poor learners can sometimes result in good fit, though better to have good candidates). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/misc/vs.pdf&quot;) The figure above shows an example of 10-fold cross-validation. The schematic below is a visualization of the following algorithm: Break up the sample evenly into V-folds (say V=10). For each of these 10 folds, remove that portion of the sample (kept out as validation sample) and the remaining will be used to fit learners (training sample). Fit each learner on the training sample (note, some learners will have their own internal cross-validation procedure or other methods to select tuning parameters). For each observation in the corresponding training sample, predict the outcome using each of the learners, so if there are \\(p\\) learners, then where would be \\(p\\) predictions on each of the observations in validation sample). Take out another validation sample and repeat until each of the V-sets of data are removed. Compare the cross-validated fit of the learners across all observations based on specified loss function (e.g., squared error, negative log-likelihood, …) by calculating the corresponding average loss (risk). Either: choose the learner with smallest risk and apply that learner to entire data set (resulting SL fit), do a weighted average of the learners to minimize the cross-validated risk (construct an ensemble of learners), by re-fitting the learners on the original data set, and use the weights above to get the file SL fit. Note, this entire procedure can be itself cross-validated to get a consistent estimate of the future performance of the SL fit. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/misc/SLKaiserNew.pdf&quot;) For prediction, one can use the cross-validated risk to empirically determine the relative performance of SL and competing methods. Below shows the results of such a study, comparing the fits of several different learners, including the SL algorithms. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/misc/ericSL.pdf&quot;) 2.5.2 Substitution Estimators Beyond a fit of the prediction function, one might also want to estimate more targeted parameters specific to certain scientific questions. The approach is to plug into the estimand of interest estimates of the relevant distributions. Sometimes, we can use simple empirical distributions, but averaging some function over the observations (e.g., giving weight \\(1/n\\) for all observations). Other parts of the distribution, like conditional means or probabilities, the estimate will require some sort of smoothing due to the curse of dimensionality. We give one example using an example of the average treatment effect (see above): \\(\\Psi(P_0) = \\Psi(Q_0) = \\mathbb{E}_0 \\big[\\mathbb{E}_0[Y \\mid A = 1, W] - \\mathbb{E}_0[Y \\mid A = 0, W]\\big]\\), where \\(Q_0\\) represents both the distribution of \\(Y \\mid A,W\\) and distribution of \\(W\\). Let \\(\\bar{Q}_0(A,W) \\equiv E_0(Y \\mid A,W)\\) and \\(Q_{0,W}(w) = P_0 (W=w)\\), then \\[ \\Psi(Q_0) = \\sum_w \\{ \\bar{Q}_0(1,w)-\\bar{Q}_0(0,w)\\} Q_{0,W}(w) \\] The Substitution Estimator plugs in the empirical distribution (weight \\(1/n\\) for each observation) for \\(Q_{0,W}(W_i)\\), and some estimate of the regression of \\(Y\\) on \\((A,W)\\) (say SL fit): \\[ \\Psi(Q_n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\{ \\bar{Q}_n(1,W_i)-\\bar{Q}_n(0,W_i)\\} \\] Thus, it becomes the average of the differences in predictions from the fit keeping the observed \\(W\\), but first replacing \\(A=1\\) and then the same but all \\(A=0\\). 2.5.3 TMLE Though using SL over an arbitrary parametric regression is an improvement, it’s not sufficient to have the properties of an estimator one needs for rigorous inference. Because the variance-bias trade-off in the SL is focused on the prediction model, it can, for instance, under-fit portions of the distributions that are critical for estimating the parameter of interest, \\(\\Psi(P_0)\\). TMLE keeps the benefits of substitution estimators (it is one), but augments the original estimates to correct for this issue and also results in an asymptotically linear (and thus normally-distributed) estimator with consistent Wald-style confidence intervals. Produces a well-defined, unbiased, efficient substitution estimator of target parameters of a data-generating distribution. Updates an initial (super learner) estimate of the relevant part of the data-generating distribution possibly using an estimate of a nuisance parameter (like the model of intervention given covariates). Removes asymptotic residual bias of initial estimator for the target parameter, if it uses a consistent estimator of \\(g_0\\). If initial estimator was consistent for the target parameter, the additional fitting of the data in the targeting step may remove finite sample bias, and preserves consistency property of the initial estimator. If the initial estimator and the estimator of \\(g_0\\) are both consistent, then it is also asymptotically efficient according to semi-parametric statistical model efficiency theory. Thus, every effort is made to achieve minimal bias and the asymptotic semi-parametric efficiency bound for the variance. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/misc/TMLEimage.pdf&quot;) There are different types of TMLE, sometimes for the same set of parameters, but below is an example of the algorithm for estimating the ATE. In this case, one can present the estimator as: \\[ \\Psi(Q^*_n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\{ \\bar{Q}^*_n(1,W_i)-\\bar{Q}^*_n(0,W_i)\\} \\] where \\(\\bar{Q}^*_n(A,W)\\) is the TMLE augmented estimate. \\(f(\\bar{Q}^*_n(A,W)) = f(\\bar{Q}_n(A,W)) + \\epsilon_n * h_n(A,W)\\), where \\(f(\\cdot)\\) is the appropriate link function (e.g., logit), \\(\\epsilon_n\\) is an estimated coefficient and \\(h_n(A,W)\\) is a “clever covariate”. In this case, \\(h_n(A,W) = \\frac{A}{g_n(W)}-\\frac{1-A}{1-g_n(W)}\\), with \\(g_n(W) = P_n(A=1 \\mid W)\\) being the estimated (also by SL) propensity score, so the estimator depends both on initial SL fit of the outcome regression (\\(\\bar{Q}_0\\)) and an SL fit of the propensity score (\\(g_n\\)). There are further robust augmentations that are used in tlverse, such as an added layer of cross-validation to avoid over-fitting bias (CV-TMLE), and so called methods that can more robustly estimated several parameters simultaneously (e.g., the points on a survival curve). 2.5.4 Inference The estimators we discuss are asymptotically linear, meaning that the difference in the estimate \\(\\Psi(P_n)\\) and the true parameter (\\(\\Psi(P_0)\\)) can be represented in first order by a i.i.d. sum: \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:IC} \\Psi(P_n) - \\Psi(P_0) = \\frac{1}{n} IC(O_i; \\nu) + o_p(1/\\sqrt{n}) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(IC(O_i; \\nu)\\) (the influence curve or function) is a function of the data and possibly other nuisance parameters \\(\\nu\\). Importantly, such estimators have mean-zero Gaussian limiting distributions; thus, in the univariate case, one has that \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:limit_dist} \\sqrt{n}(\\Psi(P_n) - \\Psi(P_0)) = N(0, (IC(O_i; \\nu))^2), \\end{equation}\\] so that inference for the estimator of interest may be obtained in terms of the influence function. For this simple case, a 95% confidence interval may be derived as: \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:CI} \\Psi(P^{\\star}_n) \\pm 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{n}}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(SE=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{n}}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) is the sample variance of the estimated IC’s: \\(IC(O; \\hat{\\nu})\\). One can use the functional delta method to derive the influence curve if a parameter of interest may be written as a function of other asymptotically linear estimators. Thus, we can derive robust inference for parameters that are estimated by fitting complex, machine learning algorithms and these methods are computationally quick (do not rely on re-sampling based methods like the bootstrap). 2.6 The WASH Benefits Example Dataset The data come from a study of the effect of water quality, sanitation, hand washing, and nutritional interventions on child development in rural Bangladesh (WASH Benefits Bangladesh): a cluster-randomised controlled trial (Luby et al. 2018). The study enrolled pregnant women in their first or second trimester from the rural villages of Gazipur, Kishoreganj, Mymensingh, and Tangail districts of central Bangladesh, with an average of eight women per cluster. Groups of eight geographically adjacent clusters were block-randomised, using a random number generator, into six intervention groups (all of which received weekly visits from a community health promoter for the first 6 months and every 2 weeks for the next 18 months) and a double-sized control group (no intervention or health promoter visit). The six intervention groups were: chlorinated drinking water; improved sanitation; hand-washing with soap; combined water, sanitation, and hand washing; improved nutrition through counseling and provision of lipid-based nutrient supplements; and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition. In the workshop, we concentrate on child growth (size for age) as the outcome of interest.

We could, with available options, account for the clustering of the data (within sampled geographic units), but, for simplification, we avoid these details in these workshop presentations, although modifications of our methodology for biased samples, repeated measures, etc., are available. We have 28 variables measured, of which 1 variable is set to be the outcome of interest. This outcome, \\(Y\\), is the weight-for-height Z-score (whz in dat); the treatment of interest, \\(A\\), is the randomized treatment group (tr in dat); and the adjustment set, \\(W\\), consists simply of everything else. This results in our observed data structure being \\(n\\) i.i.d. copies of \\(O_i = (W_i, A_i, Y_i)\\), for \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\).

Rationalize the need to remove bias from the super learner to make an optimal bias-variance tradeoff for the parameter of interest. 3.2 Introduction Now that we have defined the statistical estimation problem in The Targeted Learning Roadmap, we are ready construct the TMLE; an asymptotically efficient substitution estimator of this target quantity. The first step in this estimation procedure is an initial estimate of the data-generating distribution, or the relevant part of this distribution that is needed to evaluate the target parameter. For this initial estimation, we use the super learner (van der Laan, Polley, and Hubbard 2007), an important step for creating a robust estimator. Super Learner Loss-function-based tool that uses V-fold cross-validation to obtain the best prediction of the relevant part of the likelihood that’s needed to evaluate target parameter. Requires expressing the estimand as the minimizer of an expected loss, and proposing a library of algorithms (“learners” in sl3 nomenclature) that we think might be consistent with the true data-generating distribution. Proven to be asymptotically as accurate as the best possible prediction algorithm that is tested (van der Laan and Dudoit 2003; van der Vaart, Dudoit, and van der Laan 2006). The discrete super learner, or cross-validated selector, is the algorithm in the library that minimizes the V-fold cross-validated empirical risk. The continuous super learner is a weighted average of the library of algorithms, where the weights are chosen to minimize the V-fold cross-validated empirical risk of the library. Restricting the weights (“metalearner” in sl3 nomenclature) to be positive and sum to one (convex combination) has been shown to improve upon the discrete super learner (Polley and van der Laan 2010; van der Laan, Polley, and Hubbard 2007). This background material is described in greater detail in the accompanying tlverse handbook sl3 chapter. 3.3 Basic sl3 Implementation We begin by illustrating the core functionality of the super learner algorithm as implemented in sl3. The sl3 implementation consists of the following steps: Load the necessary libraries and data Define the machine learning task Make a super learner by creating library of base learners and a metalearner Train the super learner on the machine learning task Obtain predicted values WASH Benefits Study Example Using the WASH data, we are interested in predicting weight-for-height z-score whz using the available covariate data. 0.

Define the machine learning task To define the machine learning “task” (predict weight-for-height z-score whz using the available covariate data), we need to create an sl3_Task object. The sl3_Task keeps track of the roles the variables play in the machine learning problem, the data, and any metadata (e.g., observational-level weights, id, offset). # specify the outcome and covariates outcome &lt;- &quot;whz&quot; covars &lt;- colnames(washb_data)[-which(names(washb_data) == outcome)] # create the sl3 task washb_task &lt;- make_sl3_Task( data = washb_data, covariates = covars, outcome = outcome ) Warning in process_data(data, nodes, column_names = column_names, flag = flag, : Missing covariate data detected: imputing covariates. # examine the task washb_task A sl3 Task with 4695 obs and these nodes: $covariates [1] &quot;tr&quot; &quot;fracode&quot; &quot;month&quot; &quot;aged&quot; [5] &quot;sex&quot; &quot;momage&quot; &quot;momedu&quot; &quot;momheight&quot; [9] &quot;hfiacat&quot; &quot;Nlt18&quot; &quot;Ncomp&quot; &quot;watmin&quot; [13] &quot;elec&quot; &quot;floor&quot; &quot;walls&quot; &quot;roof&quot; [17] &quot;asset_wardrobe&quot; &quot;asset_table&quot; &quot;asset_chair&quot; &quot;asset_khat&quot; [21] &quot;asset_chouki&quot; &quot;asset_tv&quot; &quot;asset_refrig&quot; &quot;asset_bike&quot; [25] &quot;asset_moto&quot; &quot;asset_sewmach&quot; &quot;asset_mobile&quot; &quot;delta_momage&quot; [29] &quot;delta_momheight&quot; $outcome [1] &quot;whz&quot; $id NULL $weights NULL $offset NULL 2. Make a super learner Now that we have defined our machine learning problem with the task, we are ready to “make” the super learner. This requires specification of Base learning algorithms, to establish a library of learners that we think might be consistent with the true data-generating distribution. Metalearner, to ensemble the base learners. We might also incorporate Feature selection, to pass only a subset of the predictors to the algorithm. Hyperparameter specification, to tune base learners. Learners have properties that indicate what features they support. We may use sl3_list_properties() to get a list of all properties supported by at least one learner. sl3_list_properties() [1] &quot;binomial&quot; &quot;categorical&quot; &quot;continuous&quot; [4] &quot;cv&quot; &quot;density&quot; &quot;ids&quot; [7] &quot;multivariate_outcome&quot; &quot;offset&quot; &quot;preprocessing&quot; [10] &quot;timeseries&quot; &quot;weights&quot; &quot;wrapper&quot; Since we have a continuous outcome, we may identify the learners that support this outcome type with sl3_list_learners(). sl3_list_learners(c(&quot;continuous&quot;)) [1] &quot;Lrnr_arima&quot; &quot;Lrnr_bartMachine&quot; [3] &quot;Lrnr_bilstm&quot; &quot;Lrnr_caret&quot; [5] &quot;Lrnr_condensier&quot; &quot;Lrnr_dbarts&quot; [7] &quot;Lrnr_earth&quot; &quot;Lrnr_expSmooth&quot; [9] &quot;Lrnr_gam&quot; &quot;Lrnr_gbm&quot; [11] &quot;Lrnr_glm&quot; &quot;Lrnr_glm_fast&quot; [13] &quot;Lrnr_glmnet&quot; &quot;Lrnr_grf&quot; [15] &quot;Lrnr_h2o_glm&quot; &quot;Lrnr_h2o_grid&quot; [17] &quot;Lrnr_hal9001&quot; &quot;Lrnr_HarmonicReg&quot; [19] &quot;Lrnr_lstm&quot; &quot;Lrnr_mean&quot; [21] &quot;Lrnr_nnls&quot; &quot;Lrnr_optim&quot; [23] &quot;Lrnr_pkg_SuperLearner&quot; &quot;Lrnr_pkg_SuperLearner_method&quot; [25] &quot;Lrnr_pkg_SuperLearner_screener&quot; &quot;Lrnr_polspline&quot; [27] &quot;Lrnr_randomForest&quot; &quot;Lrnr_ranger&quot; [29] &quot;Lrnr_rpart&quot; &quot;Lrnr_rugarch&quot; [31] &quot;Lrnr_screener_corP&quot; &quot;Lrnr_screener_corRank&quot; [33] &quot;Lrnr_screener_randomForest&quot; &quot;Lrnr_solnp&quot; [35] &quot;Lrnr_stratified&quot; &quot;Lrnr_svm&quot; [37] &quot;Lrnr_tsDyn&quot; &quot;Lrnr_xgboost&quot; Now that we have an idea of some learners, we can construct them using the make_learner function. # choose base learners lrnr_glm &lt;- make_learner(Lrnr_glm) lrnr_mean &lt;- make_learner(Lrnr_mean) lrnr_glmnet &lt;- make_learner(Lrnr_glmnet) We can customize learner hyperparameters to incorporate a diversity of different settings. Documentation for the learners and their hyperparameters can be found in the sl3 Learners Reference. We can also include learners from the SuperLearner R package. lrnr_ranger100 &lt;- make_learner(Lrnr_ranger, num.trees = 100) lrnr_hal_simple &lt;- make_learner(Lrnr_hal9001, degrees = 1, n_folds = 2) lrnr_gam &lt;- Lrnr_pkg_SuperLearner$new(&quot;SL.gam&quot;) lrnr_bayesglm &lt;- Lrnr_pkg_SuperLearner$new(&quot;SL.bayesglm&quot;) In order to assemble the library of learners, we need to “stack” them together. A Stack is a special learner and it has the same interface as all other learners. What makes a stack special is that it combines multiple learners by training them simultaneously, so that their predictions can be either combined or compared. stack &lt;- make_learner( Stack, lrnr_glm, lrnr_mean, lrnr_ranger100, lrnr_glmnet, lrnr_gam, lrnr_bayesglm ) We will fit a non-negative least squares metalearner using Lrnr_nnls. Note that any learner can be used as a metalearner. metalearner &lt;- make_learner(Lrnr_nnls) We can optionally select a subset of available covariates and pass only those variables to the modeling algorithm. Let’s consider screening covariates based on their correlation with our outcome of interest (cor.test p-value \\(\\leq 0.1\\)). screen_cor &lt;- Lrnr_pkg_SuperLearner_screener$new(&quot;screen.corP&quot;) # which covariates are selected on the full data? screen_cor$train(washb_task) [1] &quot;Lrnr_pkg_SuperLearner_screener_screen.corP&quot; $selected [1] &quot;tr&quot; &quot;fracode&quot; &quot;aged&quot; &quot;momage&quot; [5] &quot;momedu&quot; &quot;momheight&quot; &quot;hfiacat&quot; &quot;Nlt18&quot; [9] &quot;elec&quot; &quot;floor&quot; &quot;walls&quot; &quot;asset_wardrobe&quot; [13] &quot;asset_table&quot; &quot;asset_chair&quot; &quot;asset_khat&quot; &quot;asset_chouki&quot; [17] &quot;asset_tv&quot; &quot;asset_refrig&quot; &quot;asset_moto&quot; &quot;asset_sewmach&quot; [21] &quot;asset_mobile&quot; To “pipe” only the selected covariates to the modeling algorithm, we need to make a Pipeline, which is a just set of learners to be fit sequentially, where the fit from one learner is used to define the task for the next learner. cor_pipeline &lt;- make_learner(Pipeline, screen_cor, stack) Now our learners will be preceded by a screening step. We also consider the original stack, just to compare how the feature selection methods perform in comparison to the methods without feature selection. Analogous to what we have seen before, we have to stack the pipeline and original stack together, so we may use them as base learners in our super learner. fancy_stack &lt;- make_learner(Stack, cor_pipeline, stack) # we can visualize the stack dt_stack &lt;- delayed_learner_train(fancy_stack, washb_task) plot(dt_stack, color = FALSE, height = &quot;400px&quot;, width = &quot;100%&quot;) We have made a library/stack of base learners and a metalearner, so we are ready to make the super learner.

This estimation procedure requires an “external” layer of cross-validation, also called nested cross-validation, which involves setting aside a separate holdout sample that we don’t use to fit the super learner. This external cross validation procedure may also incorporate 10 folds, which is the default in sl3. However, we will incorporate 2 outer/external folds of cross-validation for computational efficiency. We also need to specify a loss function to evaluate super learner. Documentation for the available loss functions can be found in the sl3 Loss Function Reference. washb_task_new &lt;- make_sl3_Task( data = washb_data, covariates = covars, outcome = outcome, folds = make_folds(washb_data, fold_fun = folds_vfold, V = 2) ) Warning in process_data(data, nodes, column_names = column_names, flag = flag, : Missing covariate data detected: imputing covariates.

Make a library of seven relatively fast base learning algorithms (i.e., do not consider BART or HAL). Customize hyperparameters for one of your learners. Feel free to use learners from sl3 or SuperLearner. You may use the same base learning library that is presented above. Incorporate feature selection with the SuperLearner screener screen.corP. Fit the metalearning step with non-negative least squares, Lrnr_nnls. With the metalearner and base learners, make the super learner and train it on the task. Print your super learner fit by calling print() with $. Cross-validate your super learner fit to see how well it performs on unseen data. Specify loss_squared_error as the loss function to evaluate the super learner. Like above, create a new task with 2 folds of external cross validation for computational efficiency. 3.6 Summary The general ensemble learning approach of super learner can be applied to a diversity of estimation and prediction problems that can be defined by a loss function. Plug-in estimators of the estimand are desirable because a plug-in estimator respects both the local and global constraints of the statistical model. Asymptotically linear estimators are also advantageous, since they converge to the estimand at \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) rate, and thereby permit formal statistical inference. If we plug in the estimator returned by super learner into the target parameter mapping, then we would end up with an estimator that has the same bias as what we plugged in. This estimator would not be asymptotically linear. Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) is a general strategy that succeeds in constructing asymptotically linear plug-in estimators. In the chapters that follow, we focus on the targeted maximum likelihood estimator and the targeted minimum loss-based estimator, both referred to as TMLE. References "],

As a reminder, the ATE is identified with the following statistical parameter (under assumptions): \\(ATE = \\mathbb{E}_0(Y(1)-Y(0)) = \\mathbb{E}_0\\left(\\mathbb{E}_0[Y \\mid A=1,W]-\\mathbb{E}_0[Y \\mid A=0,W] \\right)\\) This Easy-Bake implementation consists of the following steps: Load the necessary libraries and data Define the variable roles Create a “Spec” object Define the super learners Fit the TMLE Evaluate the TMLE estimates 0. Load the Data We’ll use the same WASH Benefits data as the earlier chapters: library(data.table) library(tmle3) library(sl3) washb_data &lt;- fread(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlverse/tlverse-data/master/wash-benefits/washb_data.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = TRUE) 1. Define the variable roles We’ll use the common \\(W\\) (covariates), \\(A\\) (treatment/intervention), \\(Y\\) (outcome) data structure. tmle3 needs to know what variables in the dataset correspond to each of these roles. We use a list of character vectors to tell it. We call this a “Node List” as it corresponds to the nodes in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), a way of displaying causal relationships between variables. node_list &lt;- list( W = c( &quot;month&quot;, &quot;aged&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;, &quot;momage&quot;, &quot;momedu&quot;, &quot;momheight&quot;, &quot;hfiacat&quot;, &quot;Nlt18&quot;, &quot;Ncomp&quot;, &quot;watmin&quot;, &quot;elec&quot;, &quot;floor&quot;, &quot;walls&quot;, &quot;roof&quot;, &quot;asset_wardrobe&quot;, &quot;asset_table&quot;, &quot;asset_chair&quot;, &quot;asset_khat&quot;, &quot;asset_chouki&quot;, &quot;asset_tv&quot;, &quot;asset_refrig&quot;, &quot;asset_bike&quot;, &quot;asset_moto&quot;, &quot;asset_sewmach&quot;, &quot;asset_mobile&quot; ), A = &quot;tr&quot;, Y = &quot;whz&quot; ) Handling Missingness Currently, missingness in tmle3 is handled in a fairly simple way: Missing covariates are median (for continuous) or mode (for discrete) imputed, and additional covariates indicating imputation are generated Observations missing either treatment or outcome variables are excluded. We plan to implement IPCW-TMLE to more efficiently handle missingness in the treatment and outcome variables. These steps are implemented in the process_missing function in tmle3: processed &lt;- process_missing(washb_data, node_list) washb_data &lt;- processed$data node_list &lt;- processed$node_list 2. Create a “Spec” Object tmle3 is general, and allows most components of the TMLE procedure to be specified in a modular way. However, most end-users will not be interested in manually specifying all of these components. Therefore, tmle3 implements a tmle3_Spec object that bundles a set of components into a specification that, with minimal additional detail, can be run by an end-user. We’ll start with using one of the specs, and then work our way down into the internals of tmle3. ate_spec &lt;- tmle_ATE( treatment_level = &quot;Nutrition + WSH&quot;, control_level = &quot;Control&quot; ) 3. Define the Relevant Super Learners Currently, the only other thing a user must define are the sl3 learners used to estimate the relevant factors of the likelihood: Q and g. This takes the form of a list of sl3 learners, one for each likelihood factor to be estimated with sl3: # choose base learners lrnr_mean &lt;- make_learner(Lrnr_mean) lrnr_xgboost &lt;- make_learner(Lrnr_xgboost) # define metalearners appropriate to data types ls_metalearner &lt;- make_learner(Lrnr_nnls) mn_metalearner &lt;- make_learner( Lrnr_solnp, metalearner_linear_multinomial, loss_loglik_multinomial ) sl_Y &lt;- Lrnr_sl$new( learners = list(lrnr_mean, lrnr_xgboost), metalearner = ls_metalearner ) sl_A &lt;- Lrnr_sl$new( learners = list(lrnr_mean, lrnr_xgboost), metalearner = mn_metalearner ) learner_list &lt;- list(A = sl_A, Y = sl_Y) Here, we use a Super Learner as defined in the previous sl3 section. In the future, we plan to include reasonable default learners. 4. Fit the TMLE We now have everything we need to fit the tmle using tmle3: tmle_fit &lt;- tmle3(ate_spec, washb_data, node_list, learner_list) 5. Evaluate the Estimates We can see the summary results by printing the fit object. Alternatively, we can extra results from the summary by indexing into it: print(tmle_fit) A tmle3_Fit that took 1 step(s) type param init_est tmle_est 1: ATE ATE[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}-Y_{A=Control}] 0.002440166 0.002494379 se lower upper psi_transformed lower_transformed 1: 0.05066932 -0.09681566 0.1018044 0.002494379 -0.09681566 upper_transformed 1: 0.1018044 estimates &lt;- tmle_fit$summary$psi_transformed print(estimates) [1] 0.002494379 4.3 tmle3 Components Now that we’ve successfully used a spec to obtain a TML estimate, let’s look under the hood at the components. The spec has a number of functions that generate the objects necessary to define and fit a TMLE. 4.3.1 tmle3_task First is, a tmle3_Task, analogous to an sl3_Task, containing the data we’re fitting the TMLE to, as well as an NPSEM generated from the node_list defined above, describing the variables and their relationships. tmle_task &lt;- ate_spec$make_tmle_task(washb_data, node_list) tmle_task$npsem $W tmle3_Node: W Variables: month, aged, sex, momedu, hfiacat, Nlt18, Ncomp, watmin, elec, floor, walls, roof, asset_wardrobe, asset_table, asset_chair, asset_khat, asset_chouki, asset_tv, asset_refrig, asset_bike, asset_moto, asset_sewmach, asset_mobile, momage, momheight, delta_momage, delta_momheight Parents: $A tmle3_Node: A Variables: tr Parents: W $Y tmle3_Node: Y Variables: whz Parents: A, W 4.3.2 Initial Likelihood Next, is an object representing the likelihood, factorized according to the NPSEM described above: initial_likelihood &lt;- ate_spec$make_initial_likelihood( tmle_task, learner_list ) print(initial_likelihood) W: Lf_emp A: LF_fit Y: LF_fit These components of the likelihood indicate how the factors were estimated: the marginal distribution of \\(W\\) was estimated using NP-MLE, and the conditional distributions of \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) were estimated using sl3 fits (as defined with the learner_list) above. We can use this in tandem with the tmle_task object to obtain likelihood estimates for each observation: initial_likelihood$get_likelihoods(tmle_task) W A Y 1: 0.0002129925 0.2482971 -0.6616029 2: 0.0002129925 0.2540885 -0.6351630 3: 0.0002129925 0.2578671 -0.6232142 4: 0.0002129925 0.2756704 -0.6033917 5: 0.0002129925 0.2532059 -0.5480529 --- 4691: 0.0002129925 0.1337394 -0.4698893 4692: 0.0002129925 0.1263632 -0.4882987 4693: 0.0002129925 0.1265693 -0.5709865 4694: 0.0002129925 0.1678060 -0.8143882 4695: 0.0002129925 0.1295294 -0.5452056 4.3.3 Targeted Likelihood (updater) We also need to define a “Targeted Likelihood” object. This is a special type of likelihood that is able to be updated using an tmle3_Update object. This object defines the update strategy (e.g. submodel, loss function, CV-TMLE or not, etc). targeted_likelihood &lt;- Targeted_Likelihood$new(initial_likelihood) When constructing the targeted likelihood, you can specify different update options. See the documentation for tmle3_Update for details of the different options. For example, you can disable CV-TMLE (the default in tmle3) as follows: targeted_likelihood_no_cv &lt;- Targeted_Likelihood$new(initial_likelihood, updater = list(cvtmle = FALSE) ) 4.3.4 Parameter Mapping Finally, we need to define the parameters of interest. Here, the spec defines a single parameter, the ATE. In the next section, we’ll see how to add additional parameters. tmle_params &lt;- ate_spec$make_params(tmle_task, targeted_likelihood) print(tmle_params) [[1]] Param_ATE: ATE[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}-Y_{A=Control}] 4.3.5 Putting it all together Having used the spec to manually generate all these components, we can now manually fit a tmle3: tmle_fit_manual &lt;- fit_tmle3( tmle_task, targeted_likelihood, tmle_params, targeted_likelihood$updater ) print(tmle_fit_manual) A tmle3_Fit that took 1 step(s) type param init_est tmle_est 1: ATE ATE[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}-Y_{A=Control}] 0.002365312 0.007351927 se lower upper psi_transformed lower_transformed 1: 0.0508875 -0.09238574 0.1070896 0.007351927 -0.09238574 upper_transformed 1: 0.1070896 The result is equivalent to fitting using the tmle3 function as above. 4.4 Fitting tmle3 with multiple parameters Above, we fit a tmle3 with just one parameter. tmle3 also supports fitting multiple parameters simultaneously. To illustrate this, we’ll use the tmle_TSM_all spec: tsm_spec &lt;- tmle_TSM_all() targeted_likelihood &lt;- Targeted_Likelihood$new(initial_likelihood) all_tsm_params &lt;- tsm_spec$make_params(tmle_task, targeted_likelihood) print(all_tsm_params) [[1]] Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=Control}] [[2]] Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=Handwashing}] [[3]] Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=Nutrition}] [[4]] Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}] [[5]] Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=Sanitation}] [[6]] Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=WSH}] [[7]] Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=Water}] This spec generates a Treatment Specific Mean (TSM) for each level of the exposure variable. Note that we must first generate a new targeted likelihood, as the old one was targeted to the ATE. However, we can recycle the initial likelihood we fit above, saving us a super learner step. 4.4.1 Delta Method We can also define parameters based on Delta Method Transformations of other parameters. For instance, we can estimate a ATE using the delta method and two of the above TSM parameters: ate_param &lt;- define_param( Param_delta, targeted_likelihood, delta_param_ATE, list(all_tsm_params[[1]], all_tsm_params[[4]]) ) print(ate_param) Param_delta: E[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}] - E[Y_{A=Control}] This can similarly be used to estimate other derived parameters like Relative Risks, and Population Attributable Risks 4.4.2 Fit We can now fit a TMLE simultaneously for all TSM parameters, as well as the above defined ATE parameter all_params &lt;- c(all_tsm_params, ate_param) tmle_fit_multiparam &lt;- fit_tmle3( tmle_task, targeted_likelihood, all_params, targeted_likelihood$updater ) print(tmle_fit_multiparam) A tmle3_Fit that took 1 step(s) type param init_est tmle_est 1: TSM E[Y_{A=Control}] -0.597539939 -0.623611880 2: TSM E[Y_{A=Handwashing}] -0.609703345 -0.631852129 3: TSM E[Y_{A=Nutrition}] -0.605359130 -0.629177873 4: TSM E[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}] -0.595174627 -0.616086726 5: TSM E[Y_{A=Sanitation}] -0.591126610 -0.585274354 6: TSM E[Y_{A=WSH}] -0.534109850 -0.454598371 7: TSM E[Y_{A=Water}] -0.579807128 -0.527605528 8: ATE E[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}] - E[Y_{A=Control}] 0.002365312 0.007525155 se lower upper psi_transformed lower_transformed 1: 0.02971645 -0.68185506 -0.5653687 -0.623611880 -0.68185506 2: 0.04178946 -0.71375797 -0.5499463 -0.631852129 -0.71375797 3: 0.04249393 -0.71246444 -0.5458913 -0.629177873 -0.71246444 4: 0.04143352 -0.69729494 -0.5348785 -0.616086726 -0.69729494 5: 0.04254009 -0.66865139 -0.5018973 -0.585274354 -0.66865139 6: 0.04544601 -0.54367092 -0.3655258 -0.454598371 -0.54367092 7: 0.03884802 -0.60374624 -0.4514648 -0.527605528 -0.60374624 8: 0.05087455 -0.09218712 0.1072374 0.007525155 -0.09218712 upper_transformed 1: -0.5653687 2: -0.5499463 3: -0.5458913 4: -0.5348785 5: -0.5018973 6: -0.3655258 7: -0.4514648 8: 0.1072374 4.5 Stratified Effect Estimates TMLE can also be applied to estimate effects in in strata of a baseline covariate. The tmle_stratified spec makes it easy to extend an existing spec with stratification. For instance, we can estimate strata specific ATEs as follows: \\(ATE = \\mathbb{E}_0(Y(1)-Y(0) \\mid V=v ) = \\mathbb{E}_0\\left(\\mathbb{E}_0[Y \\mid A=1,W]-\\mathbb{E}_0[Y \\mid A=0,W] \\mid V=v \\right)\\) For example, we can stratify the above ATE spec to estimate the ATE in strata of sex: stratified_ate_spec &lt;- tmle_stratified(ate_spec, &quot;sex&quot;) stratified_fit &lt;- tmle3(stratified_ate_spec, washb_data, node_list, learner_list) print(stratified_fit) A tmle3_Fit that took 1 step(s) type param 1: ATE ATE[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}-Y_{A=Control}] 2: stratified ATE ATE[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}-Y_{A=Control}] | V=male 3: stratified ATE ATE[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}-Y_{A=Control}] | V=female init_est tmle_est se lower upper psi_transformed 1: 0.002348573 0.009762099 0.05099241 -0.0901812 0.1097054 0.009762099 2: 0.002043759 0.035573930 0.07639247 -0.1141526 0.1853004 0.035573930 3: 0.002652220 -0.015950963 0.06759695 -0.1484386 0.1165366 -0.015950963 lower_transformed upper_transformed 1: -0.0901812 0.1097054 2: -0.1141526 0.1853004 3: -0.1484386 0.1165366 This TMLE is consistent for both the marginal ATE as well as the ATEs in strata of V. For continuous V, this could be extended using a working Marginal Structural Model (MSM), although that has not yet been implemented in tmle3. 4.6 Exercise Follow the steps below to estimate an average treatment effect using data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP), available in the sl3 package. To simplify this example, we define a binary intervention variable, parity01 – an indicator of having one or more children before the current child and a binary outcome, haz01 – an indicator of having an above average height for age. Work with a buddy/team. You have 20 minutes. In the etherpad, submit your group’s answers to the following: Interpret the tmle3 fit both causally and statistically. Did your group face any challenges? Any additional comments/questions about this tmle3 section of the workshop? # load the data set data(cpp) cpp &lt;- cpp[!is.na(cpp[, &quot;haz&quot;]), ] cpp$parity01 &lt;- as.numeric(cpp$parity &gt; 0) cpp[is.na(cpp)] &lt;- 0 cpp$haz01 &lt;- as.numeric(cpp$haz &gt; 0) Define the variable roles \\((W,A,Y)\\) by creating a list of these nodes. Include the following baseline covariates in \\(W\\): apgar1, apgar5, gagebrth, mage, meducyrs, sexn. Both \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) are specified above. Define a tmle3_Spec object for the ATE, tmle_ATE(). Using the same base learning libraries defined above, specify sl3 base learners for estimation of \\(Q = E(Y|A,Y)\\) and \\(g=P(A|W)\\). Define the metalearner like below metalearner &lt;- make_learner(Lrnr_solnp, loss_function = loss_loglik_binomial, learner_function = metalearner_logistic_binomial ) Define one super learner for estimating \\(Q\\) and another for estimating \\(g\\). Use the metalearner above for both \\(Q\\) and \\(g\\) super learners. Create a list of the two super learners defined in Step 5 and call this object learner_list. The list names should be A (defining the super learner for estimating \\(g\\)) and Y (defining the super learner for estimating \\(Q\\)). Fit the tmle with the tmle3 function by specifying (1) the tmle3_Spec, which we defined in Step 2; (2) the data; (3) the list of nodes, which we specified in Step 1; and (4) the list of super learners for estimating \\(g\\) and \\(Q\\), which we defined in Step 6. Note: Like before, you will need to make a data copy to deal with data.table weirdness (cpp2 &lt;- data.table::copy(cpp)) and use cpp2 as the data. 4.7 Summary tmle3 is a general purpose framework for generating TML estimates. The easiest way to use it is to use a predefined spec, allowing you to just fill in the blanks for the data, variable roles, and sl3 learners. However, digging under the hood allows users to specify a wide range of TMLEs. In the next sections, we’ll see how this framework can be used to estimate advanced parameters such as optimal treatments and shift interventions. "],
["r6.html", "Chapter 5 A Primer on the R6 Class System 5.1 Classes, Fields, and Methods 5.2 Object Oriented Programming: Python and R", " Chapter 5 A Primer on the R6 Class System A central goal of the Targeted Learning statistical paradigm is to estimate scientifically relevant parameters in realistic (usually nonparametric) models. The tlverse is designed using basic OOP principles and the R6 OOP framework. While we’ve tried to make it easy to use the tlverse packages without worrying much about OOP, it is helpful to have some intuition about how the tlverse is structured. Here, we briefly outline some key concepts from OOP. Readers familiar with OOP basics are invited to skip this section. 5.1 Classes, Fields, and Methods The key concept of OOP is that of an object, a collection of data and functions that corresponds to some conceptual unit. Objects have two main types of elements: fields, which can be thought of as nouns, are information about an object, and methods, which can be thought of as verbs, are actions an object can perform. Objects are members of classes, which define what those specific fields and methods are. Classes can inherit elements from other classes (sometimes called base classes) – accordingly, classes that are similar, but not exactly the same, can share some parts of their definitions. Many different implementations of OOP exist, with variations in how these concepts are implemented and used. R has several different implementations, including S3, S4, reference classes, and R6. The tlverse uses the R6 implementation. In R6, methods and fields of a class object are accessed using the $ operator. For a more thorough introduction to R’s various OOP systems, see http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html, from Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R (Wickham 2014). 5.2 Object Oriented Programming: Python and R OO concepts (classes with inherentence) were baked into Python from the first published version (version 0.9 in 1991). In contrast, R gets its OO “approach” from its predecessor, S, first released in 1976. For the first 15 years, S had no support for classes, then, suddenly, S got two OO frameworks bolted on in rapid succession: informal classes with S3 in 1991, and formal classes with S4 in 1998. This process continues, with new OO frameworks being periodically released, to try to improve the lackluster OO support in R, with reference classes (R5, 2010) and R6 (2014). Of these, R6 behaves most like Python classes (and also most like OOP focused languages like C++ and Java), including having method definitions be part of class definitions, and allowing objects to be modified by reference.
